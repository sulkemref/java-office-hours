    - Variables
        - Primitive Type Variables Declare and Assign Values
        Declare and Assign value to Variables
        DataType variableName = VALUE;
        DataType variableName1, variableName2 ;
        variableName1 = VALUE;
        variableName2 = VALUE;
        - Casting Examples
        average is double data type
         average = (firstInt+secondInt)/2;  // datatype ---> double : implicit casting is done by machine/compiler
         average = (double)(firstInt+secondInt)/2;
         (double)(firstInt+secondInt) ---> explicit casting is done by coder(person)

    - Concatenation
    - Operators
    - If Statements
        Conditional Statements: if - else --- work with boolean results
            if( condition) {true: do this } else {do something else}
            condition should produce boolean result
            Relational Operators: > , < , == , !=, >=, <=
            Logical Operators : & , | , && , ||

* How to solve any Coding Task?
        pseudo code: steps to achieve the result without actual coding language
        coding language is just a tool

Example Tasks:
Task 1:
Write a Java program that accepts two integers and then prints the sum, the difference, the product, the average, the distance (the difference between integer), the maximum (the larger of the two integers), the minimum (smaller of the two integers).
Input Data
Input 1st integer: 25
Input 2nd integer: 5
Expected Output:
Input 1st integer: 25
Input 2nd integer: 5
Sum of two integers: 30
Difference of two integers: 20
Product of two integers: 125
Average of two integers: 15.00
Distance of two integers: 20
Max integer: 25
Min integer: 5

Task 2:
Write a Java program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer.
An integer is a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 23, 6, 0, and âˆ’1245 are integers.
Input Data
Input an integer between 0 and 1000: 565
Expected Output :
The sum of all digits in 565 is 16

Task 3:
Write a Java program to compute body mass index (BMI).
BMI: The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
Input Data
Input weight in pounds: 452
Input height in inches: 72
Expected Output:
Input weight in pounds: 452
Input height in inches: 72
Body Mass Index is 61.30159143458721

Task 4:
Write a Java program to calculate the sum of two integers and return true if the sum is equal to a third integer.
Sample Input and Output
Input the first number : 5
Input the second number: 10
Input the third number : 15
The result is: true

a , b , c  ----- is c = a + b ;  is a = b + c ; is b = a+ c  : if any of these conditions is true then our result should be true , otherwise false

Task 5
Write a Java program that accepts two integer values between 25 to 75 and return true if there is a common digit in both numbers.
Sample Input and Output
Input the first number : 53
Input the second number: 34
Result: true
