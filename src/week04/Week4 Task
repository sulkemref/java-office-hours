Tasks: 

  Task 1: 
  Write a function:
			that, given a positive integer N  However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 shouldbe replaced by the word

				    			Codility -- 2
				    			Test     -- 3
				    			Coders   -- 5

			- If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers:2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order.

				    			EXPECTED

				    	numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replac√©e by CodilityTest
				    	INPUT : 6    OUTPUT :  CodilityTest

				    	numbers divisible by allthree numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
				    	INPUT : 30    OUTPUT :  CodilityTestCoders


Task 2:
 Given a character, the task is to check whether the given character is in upper case, lower case, or non-alphabetic 		character

							Input: ch = 'A'
							Output: A is an UpperCase character

							Input: ch = 'a'
							Output: a is an LowerCase character

							Input: ch = '0'
							Output: 0 is not an aplhabetic character

Task 3: 



					        Create a program that accepts age and weight(kg) as int.

					        If age greater than or equal 18 and weight greater than 50 kg give a message
					        	EXPECTED  :  "You are eligible to donate blood"

					        If age greater than or equal 18 and weight smaller or equal than 50 kg give a message
					        	EXPECTED  :  "You are not eligible to donate blood"

					        If age is smaller than 18 "Age must be greater than 18"
					        	EXPECTED  :  "Age must be greater than 18"

  
Task 4: 

Given two integer inputs from user a and b and compare two values return the bigger one (use ternary)

Task 5:

							DOG 	- domestic animal
							CAT 	- domestic animal
							TIGER 	- wild  animal
