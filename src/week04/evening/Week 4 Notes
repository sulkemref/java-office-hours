Review Questions

1- What do you know about pre and post increment/decrement?
int a=5;
System.out.println(++a);//if pre increment first increment and do your job //6
System.out.println(a); //6
int b=6;
System.out.println(b++); //first do your job (print it which is 6) then increment
System.out.println(b); //7


2- What is the difference between & and && ?

first_condition & second_condition (compiler will check all of them)
first_condition && second_condition
(if the first condition is false compiler will not look at the second one )
(if the first condition is true compiler will look at the second one also)

Topics:
 
  * Nested If (pre condition)
  * Ternaries
  * Switch Statement
  * Scanner


  =======================================
  Nested If

   - Pre-condition

   if(condition){ //pre condition for second if statement

    if(condition){

   
    }

   }

  =======================================
   Ternaries

   Ternaries: shortcut of if statement
if:        (Condition)?
else:                 :
else if:   :(Condition)?



Scanner

Scanner Class: used for getting user inputs

in order to use it: 

Needs to create an object from Scnanner

Syntax: 
Scanner referenceName = new Scanner(System.in);

Scanner methods:

	* nextInt() :in order to get int value from user as input
	* nextDouble() :in order to get double value from user as input
	* nextBoolean() :in order to get boolean value from user as input
	* next() :in order to get String value (only one word) from user as input
	* nextLine() :in order to get String value (with spaces) from user as input



***** if we are using nextLine() method after the other methods of scanner, we MUST provide one addition nextLine()
========================================
Switch Statement

Switch Statement: switch, case, default, break

syntax:

switch(Data){
       case data1:

        Statements;
        break;

       case data2:

       Statements;
       break;

       default:

       Statements;
       break;
}


- Case value MUST match with switch' data type and UNIQUE
- Switch' Data can not be long, float, double and boolean data types
- break: used for exiting the switch.
  ** if we don't give the break statement, switch statement continue to execute the next block(s) until the break statement

- default block gets executed if none of the case blocks matched. there can only be ONE DEFAULT block
