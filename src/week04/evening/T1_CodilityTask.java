  Write a function:

				    			Codility -- 2
				    			Test     -- 3
				    			Coders   -- 5

			- If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers:2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order.

				    			EXPECTED

				    	numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replacÃ©e by CodilityTest
				    	INPUT : 6    OUTPUT :  CodilityTest

				    	numbers divisible by allthree numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
				    	INPUT : 30    OUTPUT :  CodilityTestCoders
