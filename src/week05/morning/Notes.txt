String and String Methods

Task01:
Write a Java program to read a string and return true if "good" appears starting at index 0 or 1 in the given string.
input: goodinstructor --> true
input: agoodguy --> true
input: nogoodguy  --> false

We need to use substring, substring(2) -  beginning index  substring(2,6) -- between these indexes: include index 2 up to 6 (not included)
contains method will return true

Task02:
Write a Java program to check whether the first two characters present at the end of a given string.
The given strings is: educated
The first two characters appear in the last is: true

Task03
Follow up Task02;  if a substring of length two appears at both its beginning and end, return a string without the substring at the beginning otherwise, return the original string unchanged.
The given strings is: educated
The new string is: ucated

Task04   (Reminder for Future Office Hours: with looping and checking if it is number or alphabetic chars, in real life we would use split() method -- requires Array knowledge)
Dynamically locate the column (:) in the given result String, then just print out the numbers from the given result String using substring method. Your solution should be capable enough to work for different size of numbers or location of (:)
input1:  String result = "result count:12345";
output1:  12345
input1:  String result = "result count : 3007";
output1:  3007

Task05
Reverse a given String of length 5, and if original and reversed strings are same print true
input: "madam" --------reversed word=madam

last index : str.length-1  and assign it to 0 index
output : true  -- palindrome
input: "hello"
output: false  --- reversed word= olleh


Mutation: changing
Strings are immutable
